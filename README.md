# SparkML-Churn-Prediction
Customer churn prediction using spark MLlib with large-scale dataset.

# Motivation
Customer churn rate prediction is a very challenging problem and itâ€™s also a very common task that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. In this project, we aim to predict customer-churn behaviour with large-scale dataset using Spark machine learning libraries.

# Tools and platforms:
Python (3.5)
Spark (2.3.2)
Cloud Computing platform : AWS EMR, S3 and IBM watson Studio
